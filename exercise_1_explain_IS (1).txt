StudentWithTax: {float tax;}
Secretary: {int id, String name, String email, List<Report> reports}
Grade: {int id, float value, int day, int month, int year, Student student, Professor professor}

6.	Conceptual relations:

Professor -> Grade: 1 to N
Student -> Grade: 1 to N
Secretary -> Report: 1 to N
